I will regenerate all three files for the DevOps Portfolio Website with the two new features (Dark Mode and Skills Tracker) below. Please ensure the file blocks load correctly for you this time.

Here is the complete, self-contained code for the entire project:

1. HTML Structure (index.html)
This file contains the content and links the CSS and JavaScript files.

2. CSS Stylesheet (style.css)
This file contains all the design rules, including variables for the Dark Mode feature and styling for the interactive progress bars.

3. JavaScript Logic (script.js)
This file handles the interactivity, saves the theme preference, and renders the technical skills data (mocking an API call).
